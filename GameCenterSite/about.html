            <h2>A Brief History of Games</h2>
            <p>
                Video games have come a long way since the early days of pixelated screens and coin-operated arcade
                machines. What began as simple blips on a screen in classics like <em>Pong</em> (1972) quickly grew into
                a creative and technical revolution. The late 70s and early 80s brought us icons like <em>Space
                    Invaders</em>, <em>Donkey Kong</em>, and <em>Pac-Man</em>—games that introduced the world to
                competitive high scores and legendary characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1980s and 90s, home consoles like the <strong>Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</strong> and
                <strong>Sega Genesis</strong> brought gaming into the living room. Franchises like <em>Super Mario
                    Bros.</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, <em>Street Fighter</em>, and <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>
                became household names. This era laid the foundation for storytelling, gameplay mechanics, and
                character-driven design.
            </p>
            <p>
                The late 90s and early 2000s marked the transition to 3D gaming with systems like the
                <strong>PlayStation</strong>, <strong>Nintendo 64</strong>, and <strong>Xbox</strong>. Games such as
                <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, <em>Halo</em>, and <em>Ocarina of Time</em> showed the potential of
                immersive worlds and cinematic storytelling. Multiplayer gaming began to thrive, both on consoles and
                PCs, with titles like <em>Counter-Strike</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, video games are a cultural powerhouse. We've entered the era of high-definition graphics, virtual
                reality, and massive online communities. Blockbusters like <em>God of War</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>,
                <em>Fortnite</em>, and <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> showcase the emotional depth, realism, and scale
                modern games can achieve. Indie games like <em>Hades</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em> also prove that
                passion and creativity can shine even without a big studio.
            </p>
            <p>
                At <strong>Game Center</strong>, we honor both the roots and the future of gaming. Whether you're a fan
                of retro consoles, love collecting cartridges, enjoy competitive esports, or just want to explore rich
                story-driven worlds — there's something here for you. Gaming is more than entertainment — it's a shared
                experience, a community, and for many, a way of life.
